  abstract  = "Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Bayesian Models with R-INLA provides
               a much needed, practically oriented \& innovative presentation
               of the combination of Bayesian methodology and spatial
               statistics. The authors combine an introduction to Bayesian
               theory and methodology with a focus on the spatial and
               spatio­-temporal models used within the Bayesian framework and a
               series of practical examples which allow the reader to link the
               statistical theory presented to real data problems. The numerous
               examples from the fields of epidemiology, biostatistics and
               social science all are coded in the R package R-INLA, which has
               proven to be a valid alternative to the commonly used Markov
               Chain Monte Carlo simulations",

               Investigating updated treatments of spatial autocorrelation and
               spatio-temporal analysis • Introducing detailed explanations of
