  abstract  = "Nowadays, ecologists worldwide recognize the use of spatial
               analysis as essential. However, because of the fast-growing
               range of methods available, even an expert might occasionally
               find it challenging to choose the most appropriate one.
               Providing the ecological and statistical foundations needed to
               make the right decision, this second edition builds and expands
               upon the previous one by: • Encompassing the basic methods for
               spatial analysis, for both complete census and sample data •
               Investigating updated treatments of spatial autocorrelation and
               spatio-temporal analysis • Introducing detailed explanations of
               currently developing approaches, including spatial and
               spatio-temporal graph theory, scan statistics, fibre process
               analysis, and Hierarchical Bayesian analysis • Offering
               practical advice for specific circumstances, such as how to
               analyze forest Permanent Sample Plot data and how to proceed
               with transect data when portions of the data series are missing.
               Written for graduates, researchers and professionals, this book
               will be a valuable source of reference for years to come.",
