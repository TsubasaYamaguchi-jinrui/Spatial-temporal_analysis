               high-quality graphs quickly---without having to comb through all
               the details of R's graphing systems. Each recipe tackles a
               specific problem with a solution you can apply to your own
               project and includes a discussion of how and why the recipe
               works.Most of the recipes in this second edition use the updated
               version of the ggplot2 package, a powerful and flexible way to
               make graphs in R. You'll also find expanded content about the
               visual design of graphics. If you have at least a basic
               understanding of the R language, you're ready to get started
               with this easy-to-use reference.Use R's default graphics for
