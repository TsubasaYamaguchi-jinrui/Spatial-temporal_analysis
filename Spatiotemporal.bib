               brasilianus in the Argentine Sea. A total of 156 specimens
               caught during spring 2006, off the coasts of Buenos Aires
               Province (38°27′ S; 57°90′ W, n = 54), San Matias Gulf (42° S;

               monogeneans, digeneans, cestodes, nematodes, acanthocephalans
               and crustaceans. Diet analyses showed that Brazilian sandperch
               feed mainly on benthic macroinvertebrates, with differences in
               relative importance of main items between zones. Univariate
               analysis on parasite population descriptors, as well as a
               discriminant analysis, allowed the identification of discrete
               stocks in each zone, although a higher degree of similarity was
               observed between both Patagonian Gulfs. Northern samples were
               characterized by higher values of prevalence and abundance of
               Grillotia sp., Corynosoma australe and Scolex polymorphus. On
               the other hand, Trifur tortuosus and Opecoelidae gen. sp. were
               important in determining the position of Patagonian samples and
               were specially related to those from Nuevo Gulf, whereas none of
               the species was clearly related only to fish from San Matias
               Gulf. The size of the hosts is likely to influence the
               similarity among zones, with larger fish as better tools to
               discriminate stocks, probably because they harbour `mature'
               assemblages shaped longer by differential environmental
               conditions and diet in each zone. Parasite species
               characteristic of sandperch from Buenos Aires Province, which
               display very low specificity among fish species in this area,
               have been previously identified as biological tags for other

              and returns nearly identical estimates for fixed parameters in
              comparison to OpenBUGS, but falls short in recovering the true
              estimates for the random effects, their precisions, and model
              goodness of fit measures under the default settings. We assumed
              default settings for ground truth parameters, and through
              altering these default settings in our simulation study, we were

               find it challenging to choose the most appropriate one.
               Providing the ecological and statistical foundations needed to
               make the right decision, this second edition builds and expands
               upon the previous one by: • Encompassing the basic methods for
               spatial analysis, for both complete census and sample data •
               Investigating updated treatments of spatial autocorrelation and
               spatio-temporal analysis • Introducing detailed explanations of
               currently developing approaches, including spatial and
               spatio-temporal graph theory, scan statistics, fibre process
               analysis, and Hierarchical Bayesian analysis • Offering
               practical advice for specific circumstances, such as how to
               analyze forest Permanent Sample Plot data and how to proceed
               with transect data when portions of the data series are missing.

               is the outcome of a joint effort to systematically describe the
               use of R-INLA for analysing time series and showcasing the code
               and description by several examples. This book introduces the
               underpinnings of R-INLA and the tools needed for modelling
               different types of time series using an approximate Bayesian
               framework. The book is an ideal reference for statisticians and
               scientists who work with time series data. It provides an
               excellent resource for teaching a course on Bayesian analysis
               using state space models for time series. Key Features:
               Introduction and overview of R-INLA for time series analysis.
               Gaussian and non-Gaussian state space models for time series.
               State space models for time series with exogenous predictors.
               Hierarchical models for a potentially large set of time series.
