<p>平衡石(otholith)は魚類の96%にある耳内の器官で、海水から炭化カルシウムを生成して作られている。よって、平衡石の組成を調べればその魚がどこの海域にいたかを推定できる可能性がある。しかし、それを知るためには環境要因と生理的要因がそれぞれどのように平衡石の組成に影響しているかを調べなければならない。</p>
<p>本章では <span class="citation">Sturrock et al. (<a href="#ref-Sturrock2015">2015</a>)</span> による実験研究のデータを用いる。25個体が7から12ヶ月自然環境に近い状況でタンクに入れて飼育され、生理学的変数(全長、体重、フルトンのcondition factor<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>、成長率、血漿中のタンパク質、元素濃度)と環境的変数(塩分濃度、温度、海水の元素濃度)が少なくとも1ヶ月ごとに測定された。</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(^7Li, ^{26}Mg, ^{41}K,^{48}Ca, ^{88}Sr, ^{138}Ba\)</span>などの元素濃度が海水中、血漿中、そして平衡石中で測定された。また、性別や魚が生息していた海域、産卵を促すために特定のホルモン(GnRH)を与えられていたかなども測定された。</p>

<p>いくつかVIFの高い変数があることが分かる。ここでは保守的にVIFが3以上の変数は用いないこととする(通常は閾値は5か10で構わない)。海水中のSr濃度(<code>SW.Sr</code>)が最も高いVIF(13.31)を示している。各変数間の相関を調べてみると(図<a href="Chapter9.html#fig:cor-oto">8.3</a>)、気温(<code>Temp</code>)や塩分濃度(<code>Sal</code>)、海中Sr/Ca比(<code>SW.Sr.Ca</code>)と強く相関していることが分かる。よって、これらのどれかを除くとVIFは小さくなりそう。本章では、<code>SW.Sr</code>を除くことにする。また、これ以外にVIFが高かった全長(<code>Totallength</code>)も除くことにする。</p>

<p>モデルを解釈する際には、結果を可視化することが重要だ。ある説明変数と応答変数の関係についてみる場合には、それ以外の説明変数を固定する必要がある。通常は連続変数であれば平均を(今回は標準化しているので全て0)、離散変数であれば特定の水準に固定することが多い。これを行う方法は2つあるが、そのうち一つは前章(<a href="Chapter8.html#s8-6">7.6</a>)で解説したので、本節ではもう一つの方法も解説する。</p>

<p>まずは前章でも見た一つ目の方法で行う。以下では、血漿中タンパク質とSr/Ca比の関連についてプロットする。ここでは、ランダム効果を含まない予測値を図示したいので、<code>Fish = NA</code>とする。また、連続変数は血漿中タンパク質以外は0(<code>Opacity</code>だけ標準化されていないので平均をとる)、離散変数については<code>Origin‘は</code>EC<code>(English channel)、</code>GnRH<code>は</code>Non-treated<code>、</code>Sex<code>は</code>F`に固定する。</p>

<p>本稿では、ここまで事前分布に<code>INLA</code>のデフォルトを使用してきた。しかし、今回のように1湯のランダム切片しか持たないときは問題ないが、ランダム効果を2つ以上持つ場合や、それらに時空間的相関を仮定するときには、事前分布の影響を確認した方がよい。</p>
<p><code>INLA</code>では固定効果のパラメータのデフォルトの事前分布は平均0で精度$<span class="math inline">\(0.001の正規分布になっている。\)</span><span class="math inline">\(を\)</span><span class="math inline">\(に直すと、\)</span>= 31.62$である。</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\beta_i \sim N(0, 31.6^2)

<p>正規分布では<span class="math inline">\(±3 \times \sigma\)</span>の範囲に99%の値が入るので、この事前分布はパラメータがおよそ-95.8から94.8の値をとることを贈呈していることになる。これは十分に広い。なお、切片のパラメータの精度は0にされている。</p>
<p>以下では、事前分布を変えたときに結果がどのように変化するかを見ていく。話を単純にするため、先ほどの結果で影響があった4つの変数のみをモデルに含める。また、変数変換は行わないものとする。</p>
<p>まず、デフォルトの事前分布でモデリングを行う。</p>

<p>先ほどのモデルにはハイパーパラメータが2つあった(<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{Fish}\)</span>)。しかし、<code>INLA</code>では精度(<span class="math inline">\(\tau = 1/\sigma^2, \tau_{Fish} = 1/\sigma_{Fish}^2\)</span>が推定される。これらのデフォルトの事前分布は以下の通り。これは、<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{Fish}\)</span>がガンマ分布を事前分布に持つのと同じことである。</p>

<p>ガンマ分布は2つのパラメータshapeとscaleを持っており、それぞれ<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>とと<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>で示されることが多い。ただし、<code>INLA</code>では<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>を<strong>scaleパラメータの逆数に用いている</strong>ためややこしい。以下では、<code>INLA</code>と同様にscaleパラメータの逆数(rateパラメータという)を<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>で示す。このとき、ガンマ分布の平均は<span class="math inline">\(a/b\)</span>で分散は<span class="math inline">\(a/b^2\)</span>となる。</p>
<p><code>INLA</code>では、<span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{Fish}\)</span>の事前分布に<span class="math inline">\(Gamma(a = 1, b = 0.00001)\)</span>をしている。これは、ほぼ一様分布のようになる(図<a href="Chapter9.html#fig:gamma">8.4</a>のA)。一方で、 <span class="citation">Carroll et al.
