<p>それでは、これと同じことを1000回繰り返して得られた分布と実際のデータの分布を比較することで、モデルがデータによく当てはまっているかを検討しよう。以下に、1000回事後同時分布からサンプリングを行ってシミュレーションをしたときに得られた平均分布と実際のデータの分布を同じ図に示した。</p>
<p>モデルからシミュレートされた値は実データに比べてゼロが多く1が少ないことが分かる。また、実データは9以上のデータがないのに対してシミュレーションでは9以上のデータがある。</p>

<p>モデルではまだ残差に空間的な相関が残っていた。これについてさらに詳しく調べるため、バリオグラムを4方向に分割してみた(図<a href="Chapter13.html#fig:vario13-2b">12.5</a>)。その結果、北東方向のバリオグラムは他の方角のものよりも強い空間相関を示しているように見える。これは、大きな火山が二つある島の地理的な特徴を反映しているのだろう。</p>
