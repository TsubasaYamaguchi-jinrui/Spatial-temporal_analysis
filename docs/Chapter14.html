<p>本章では、<code>INLA</code>で扱える時系列相関を考慮したモデルについて解説する。時系列分析についてより詳しい解説が必要な場合は、他の書籍を参照されたし<span class="citation">(e.g., <a href="#ref-Baba2018">馬場 2018</a>, <a href="#ref-Baba2019">2019</a>; <a href="#ref-Ravishanker2022">Ravishanker et al. 2022</a>)</span>。</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">13.1</span> Simulation study<a href="Chapter14.html#simulation-study-1" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>以下では、シミュレーションデータを用いて話を進める。<span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>を時系列データとし、以下のモデル式をもとに得られるとする。</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;Y_t = \rm{Intercept} + \rm{Covariates_i} + \rm{Trend_t} + \epsilon_t \\
&amp;\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon})
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>ここでトレンド項(<span class="math inline">\(\rm{Trend_t}\)</span>)が<span class="math inline">\(Times \times \beta\)</span>のように表せるとすれば、これは通常の線形回帰モデルである。しかしこの場合、時間的な疑似相関が生じてしまう。この問題を解決するため、いわゆるランダムウォークが用いられる。もっとも単純なランダムウォークモデルは以下のように書ける。<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;Y_t = \rm{Intercept} + \rm{Covariates_i} + \mu_t + \epsilon_t \\
&amp;\mu_t = \mu_{t-1} + v_t\\
&amp;\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon}) \; and \; v_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_v)
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>このモデルでは、互いに独立な残差<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(v_t\)</span>がある。以下、これらについて理解するために<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\epsilon}\)</span>と<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{v}\)</span>に様々な値を当てはめたときにシミュレートされる<span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>を図示したのが図<a href="Chapter14.html#fig:timeseries-sim">13.1</a>である。1行目の3つは<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\epsilon} = 1,\sigma_v = 1\)</span><span class="math inline">\(、2行目の3つは\)</span><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\epsilon} = 1,\sigma_v = 0.1\)</span><span class="math inline">\(、3行目の3つは\)</span><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\epsilon} = 5, \sigma_v = 1\)</span><span class="math inline">\(、4行目の3つは\)</span><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\epsilon} = 1, \sigma_v = 5\)</span><span class="math inline">\(、5行目の3つは\)</span><span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\epsilon} = 3, \sigma_v = 3\)</span>である。なお、線は<span class="math inline">\(\mu_t\)</span>を、点は<span class="math inline">\(Y_t\)</span>を表す。</p>

<p><span class="citation">Simpson et al. (<a href="#ref-Simpson2014">2014</a>)</span> はPenalized Complexity (PC) 事前分布というものを導入している。この事前分布では、1つのパラメータを用いて事前分布の強弱を表現できる。例えば<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_v\)</span>のPC事前分布を考えるとき、以下の式に用いる<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>を決める必要がある。<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>には0.05を用いる。</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Prob(\sigma_v &gt; U) = \alpha
\]</span></p>
<p>例えば<span class="math inline">\(U = 100\)</span>とするとき、<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_v\)</span>が100以上の大きな値をとる確率は非常に小さいということを示す。このとき、事前分布はほとんど情報を持っていない。一方で、<span class="math inline">\(U = 0.1\)</span>とするならば、<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_v\)</span>は高い確率で0から0.1までの値をとることになり、事前分布は情報があるとみなせる。</p>
<p>以下では、様々な<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>を定めたときの<span class="math inline">\(\tau_v\)</span>の分布を描いたものである。密度の算出については <span class="citation">Simpson et al. (<a href="#ref-Simpson2014">2014</a>)</span> を参照。<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>が大きいほど<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_v\)</span>がとりうる範囲も大きくなるので、逆に<span class="math inline">\(\tau_v\)</span>は非常に狭い分布になる。逆もしかりである。</p>

<p>本節では、マッコウクジラの漂着を調べた <span class="citation">Smeenk (<a href="#ref-Smeenk1997">1997</a>)</span> と <span class="citation">Pierce et al. (<a href="#ref-Pierce2007">2007</a>)</span> のデータを用いる。クジラの漂着には気候変動やソナーの活動、食物の入手可能性、クジラの回遊パターン、太陽の黒点など様々な要因がかかわっていると考えられている。</p>
<p>データは1563年から2001年までの439の観察からなる。まず、以下のポワソン分布のランダムウォークモデルを適用する。また、同様の負の二項分布モデルも併せて検討する。</p>

<p>データを見てみると、時系列によってばらつきの大きさに差があることが分かる。このことから、<strong>時系列ごとにポワソン分布を適用したり負の二項分布を適用</strong>したらよりデータに合った分析ができ、先ほどのモデルで見られた過少分散も解決できる可能性があることが分かる。<code>INLA</code>ではこれを行うことができる。</p>
<p>この分析を行うためには、以下のように各列に各時系列のデータが入った以下のような行列を作成する必要がある。</p>

<p>最後に、AR1モデルについて解説する。</p>
<p>ベニザケの回遊日を研究した <span class="citation">Crozier et al. (<a href="#ref-Crozier2011">2011</a>)</span> のデータを用いるとき、AR1モデルは以下のように表せる。パラメータ<span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>はトレンドがどの程度前年に依存しているかを表す係数である。<span class="math inline">\(\rho = 1\)</span>であればランダムウォークモデルに一致する。</p>
<p><span class="math display" id="eq:AR1">\[
\begin{aligned}
&amp;MigDay_t = \rm{Intercept}  +  \mu_t + \epsilon_t \\
&amp;\mu_t = \rho \times \mu_{t-1} + v_t\\
&amp;\epsilon_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\epsilon}) \; and \; v_t \sim N(0, \sigma^2_v)
\end{aligned}
\tag{13.3}
\]</span></p>
<p>ポワソンGLMに対してAR1モデルを適用するとき、もし<span class="math inline">\(\rho = 0\)</span>であり、<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_v\)</span>が大きければ、観察レベルランダム切片をもつポワソンGLMMと同じになる。</p>

<p>AR1モデルは基本的に時間的に等間隔に並んだデータに対して用いられる。本節では、そうではないとき(欠損値があるときなど)の対処法を解説する。</p>
<p>簡単に言えば、空間モデルでメッシュを作成したように、規則正しく並んだ時間的なポイントを作成することでこの問題に対処できる。このことを説明するため、南極大陸の3か所(コア)の氷から過去の大気中のCO2の割合を調べた <span class="citation">Etheridge et al. (<a href="#ref-Etheridge1998">1998</a>)</span> のデータを用いる。</p>
